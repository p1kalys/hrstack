# HR Stack
A modern, centralized platform for Human Resource professionals to share, discover, and engage with content that matters — articles, trends, and resources curated specifically for the HR community.

## Project Motive
While software developers and engineers are surrounded by job portals, tech blogs, and curated knowledge platforms, HR professionals are often underserved despite their pivotal role in shaping workforces.

**HR Insight Hub** aims to fill that gap — by offering a platform **for HRs, by HRs**, where they can:

* Stay informed about the latest in **human resources**, **recruitment strategies**, **employee experience**, and more.
* Read and share curated **internal blogs** from contributors.
* Discover **external blog feeds** aggregated from trusted HR-focused sources via **RSS**.
* Filter content by **categories** or **search queries** for a focused reading experience.

## Features

*  **Internal Blog System** — Custom-written posts from platform contributors.
*  **External RSS Integration** — Fetches posts from multiple trusted HR sources.
*  **Search & Filter** — Quickly find relevant content by category or keyword.
*  **Category Navigation** — From Recruitment to Employee Engagement and beyond.
*  **Modern UI/UX** — Built with React, TailwindCSS, and animation libraries.
